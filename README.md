As a developer I want to expand my skill set by learning
Zurb in order to improve my knowledge base of current
web templating and css.  This basic app creates a simple
front end for adding products and price.

Store Demo:
* Improve my ability to write better README
* Improve my command of markdown
* Improve my ability to use Zurb
* Use BDD/TDD to verify presence of stylesheet
